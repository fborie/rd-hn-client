## Instructions
Clone both the client and the server(rd-hn-server) repositories, install the dependencieson each and execute them (`yarn start`for both). Follow the steps below.

## Client/Server
1. Clone repo
2. Install dependencies -> `yarn install` or use npm.
3. Run client -> `yarn start`

Do the same steps with the server, and then refresh the browser for the client. For some weird reason, I was having troubles some times with cors on a couple of request to the api through google chrome, even tho I was setting the correct access-control-* headers for the response. Opening a private window on it solved the problem ü§∑‚Äç
